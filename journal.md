So far learning how to code using phyton so far has been very interesting and has introduced to a very complex and hard way of coding. 
Wile learning phyton iv'e seen a lot of things from math such as variales which allow you to save or assign data to a placeholder  that you can reference, manipulate, and move around later in the code. And integers, integers can be saved to variables much like strings can.

When creating my journal i didn't have a lot of problems following the instructions for creating it. The only challeges i faced when creating and doing my journal was finding the journal prompts, other than that it wasn't difficult creating it.

Doing Phyton and doing Sphero, i can say that doing phyton is a harder and more complex coding style. While Sphero coding is you putting a bunch of commands toghether to make the thing your controll move and do something. While phyton takes much more thinking and requires focus to code becasue putting the wrong thing can mess up what your trying to do.

Computer Science is used everyday in my life i use it when i need to look up something on google or when i'm using my phone. Without these things in my life it would be very diffrent especially witout my phone i woudn't be able to text the people i know or call them either i also wouldn't be able to take pictures to save good memories i have.

Software Development
Looking at all the options in computer science i feel like becoming a softeare developer, intrest me the most. Software Developers job is to desgin, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many diffrent skills and tools. To become a software developer you need to have certain skills such as Programming languages, Data structures and algorithms, Databases, and so on and so on. Aslo to become a developer you need at least a bachelor's degree in a related field, such as computer science, software engineering, computer and information technology, or engineering. This job algins with my interest because i like computers and learning about the coding and software development seems very interesting to me and challenging.

Coding is an skill that goes beyond just computer science, learning to code can sharpen your mind and help with your creativity. Coding can also help with solving problems because when you are programing you must break down complex issues into smaller managable parts and think logically while doing so. Coding can also help with other things outside of computer science; it can help with multiple things of you life such as critical thinking, quicker problem sovlving skills, and also helps with you confidence, which overall help in your day to day life where you can use in other jobs you are interested in. Programming languages can develop student creativity by encouraging problem-solving, supporting personal and collaborative projects, enabling experimentation, and providing practical applications. They empower students to think innovatively and express creativity through code.

Artificial Intelligence or AI, is an helpful computer programed assittant that mimics human intelligence and is used in your day to day life, like your phones,social media,digital assistiant, and homeelectronics. Using AI as a whole has benefited humans in many ways, some things as simple setting an alarm to wake up or coding a program for a website. As much as Ai helps everybody everyday it also comes with potential risk. One common brought up topic about AI being a risk is the is it too helpful, as thechnolgy advances everyday and how much people rely on it does it effect the way of human life. One example of this is with AI advancing people lose jobs which makes it hard for people to look for jobs and keep them. As AI advances everyday a lot of people are worried for the future, seeing if AI will be the downfall of the human race or help for the better.

One of the significant positive impacts of technology on the election process is the introduction of e-voting or electronic voting.This system leverages advanced encryptio mathods to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of votes. For instance, countries like the United States have adopted this method to replace the traditional paper ballot system. Despite the benifits, the use of thechnology in elections also presents potential challenges. One of the main concers is the susceptibility of these systems to hacking or cyber-attacks.

Artificial Intelligence continues to shape the way people live and work in their day to day lives. Whith such quick advancments in AI everday there is something new about AI, an example of these advances is Multimodal AI. Multimodal AI is a single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information. With this people are able to preform complex tasks by combining different data types like text, images, audio, and video, enabling actions such as analyzing a photo while understanding spoken instructions about it, generating descriptive text responses, and making informed decisions based on diverse information sources; making it useful in applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, customer service, and advanced security systems.

The word brain rot means to me watching something or saying something with no meaning or that is dumb or stupid on purpose. One exaple of something being brain rot is a collection of videos called skibidi toilet, a animated video series where peoples heads are coming out of the toilet and doing random things in the videos.

With AI being use more than ever now companies all over the world are staring to use Ai to help and improve the workplace with all types of things.But with AI the growth rapidly taking over companies are investing in more AI which is giving less opportunities for humans to get a job.This really shows for tech comapines as studies show 95% of senior leaders reporting current investments in the technology; some compaines are planning to invest in 10 million or more to AI.With Ai being used more than ever i believe this is limiting a lot of jobs for AI and making it more difficult for people to get jobs, especially in the tech industry.

With theh Us government temporally banning tik tok for all users a lot of people question and wonder if government intervention impacts technology companies and their users? In my government involving themselves in tech related things effects users mostly because tech compaines such like tik tok collect their consumers data and the government then can take that data for themselves.\

With the recent tragic  plane crash in Washigton D.C there is a question that seems to pop up in a lot of peoples heads, how can you prevent an incident like this from happening again.One way is improving the technolgy in the aviation field, One way we can improve the technolgy in Developed by researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Air-Guardian extends beyond the limitations of traditional autopilot by forging a collaborative, symbiotic partnership with the pilot. The AI copilot leverages cutting-edge eye-tracking technology as well as “saliency maps, which pinpoint where attention is directed.” This allows for monitoring of where a pilot's gaze falls within a flight environment, from the cockpit to the skies beyond. Gathering valuable insights into the user's focus and decision-making process, Air-Guardian analyses this information in conjunction with real-time flight data to anticipate potential risks, shortcomings, and areas of improvement through detailed algorithm development. This proactive approach allows Air-Guardian to make decisions that complement the pilot's movements before or during the action, rather than after an incident has occurred.

Technolgy can play a vital role in bridging generational language and understanding between diffrent age groups. Technolgy can be used to educate and train individuals on the cultural diffrences that exist between generations. Things like onlince courses and webinars can provide valuabe insights into the communication styles and cultural background of diffrent age groups helping to foster an understanding and respect between generations.

I feel like when the substitute came the class was prettty well behaved and respectful toward the teacher and made her job as easy as possible. I hope when we left that she felt that this was a well behaved class and would gladly do it again. The thing i would change for any future substitute teacher is to be more talkitive with her for a better experience when she comes.

Wiih March Maddness here, people are placing bets and trying to perdict who will come out on top this year. When doing so a lot of people like to go to look at sports data to help them with those decisions. Even though sports analysts aren't always right its a fair guess on who will win in the end. WIth that said being said sports data has imporoved a lot with the advancments of technolgy making it as accurate as possible. But with that I feel like it takes away from the excitement and unpredictability of he game. This takes away from the excitement of the game which is why people watch sports becasue of the unpredictability of the game, and sports predictions take away from that.

With this school year coming to an end, mentally i am doing fine and very stress free: just a little nervous about SAT scores and upcoming STAAR test coming up. Physically my body is a little tired and sore, but i'll just sleep it off. For the rest of the school year i will be striving for all A's and B's in my classes, and get AB honor roll to end the school year.

I think having AI as school tutors is a great idea because, it allows the student to specifically pick what they are struggling in when learning a subject. It also allows them to study whenever whereever they want since you have AI everywhere, while giving teachers a break from after school tutoring, since the AI tutor will be there to help.

I believe when you ban student phones while at school it is a detrimental becasue, when you ban students phones you make it more likley for students to sneak phones and other electronic devices to bypass the no phone policy. Also when you ban phones it may cause kids to act in retaliation to the ban. They may protest or refuse to do work or just not even show up to school because of the ban. If a ban would to come to my school i would think this is a violation of people's rights.

I believe when you put 100 men vs 1 gorilla the 100 men win everytime. My evidence fro saying this is, if you look at both sides a gorilla is not some rampaging king kong type of monkey its a regular monkey with limits. Eventually the gorrilla will get tired by like the 30 man if that. Even though the gorilla is very strong with some type of intelligence, it can not hold back 100 men trying to goo after it, it's just not possible. With this debate going viral in the past couple of days i feel like people heavenly underestimate the strength and capabilities of humans , i also feel like peole are acting like it's supposed epeople lined up in a single file line taking turns fighting the gorilla which in that scenario the gorilla wins more often then not. At the end of the day people should'nt underestimate humans so much and realize how much 100 really is compared to 1.

A trend has gon around where peole are sticking objects like pencils into USB ports which can destroy the chrombook and cause fires if went wrong. I feel like this is such a dumb trend to have been started, not only do you put others at risk with those actions, you are destroying property that is not even yours and can lead to fines or charges put against you for a little entertaiment. Now children doing this trend are facing disciplinary action if they do the trend.

Now that school has started for me here in texas, a few changes have happened over the summer time. One major thing is the new phone law that was implemented, this new law makes it so students can not have their phones at school; with even some schools making their students put them in pouches when enteringthe school and cant unlock them until the end of the school day. My opinion on this law is, I think the new phone law is very stupid and think texas is focused on the wrong thing when it comes to public education, they should be worried about the rising number of shootings that are happening here in texas than whether or not kids are using AI on there assigments.

One carrer pathway I hope I can pursue is in graphic desgin. In graphic desgin you create visual concepts using typography, images, and color to communicate messages and solve problems for clients. Graohic Desgin uses all types of things to make there work as efficent and easy as possible. but one thing that you proably didn't know helps with graphc desgin is computer science. Computer Science provides graphic desginers the abilty to use tools and unique technology to make their work easier and more accesible for all learners and users.

I think working in a virtual job while making real money is not a bad idea. While yes it might take a toll on ones sanity, seeing as you'll be working in a virtual world for hours on in. But i think if your making money off of it and your managing your time in the real world and the virtual world pretty well, i don't think working in a virtual world is such a bad idea.

67 is a phrase used manily as just a nonsensical joke widley used among generation Alpha (ages 14 and under). The phrase was first used in a song called Doot Doot made by the rapper skrilla. The phrase first gained notoriety in basketball edits on tik tok, and then from there, the phrase became super popular among the younger generation, even being used by some celebrities.

If I was in charge of a school I would make sure that AI use would be as low as possible. AI has been a highly used tool students use to study,learn,and discover new ways to learn for any subject they may need help with, and even though AI is a major positive in today's world and helps out a lot especially in school, it is often used as a cop out to doing actual work, with most kids asking it just to give them the answers.

The problem is that SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) could run out of funding, which would be a big deal because it helps millions of low-income individuals and families afford food. If SNAP benefits are cut, food insecurity would likely increase, especially for children, seniors, and people with disabilities. Technology could help by connecting people with resources like local food banks and free meal programs through apps and websites. However, challenges exist because not everyone has access to reliable internet or a smartphone, and some people may have privacy concerns about sharing their personal information online. If I were designing a tool to help solve food insecurity, I would create an app called "NourishNet," which would provide a map of nearby food resources, allow users to anonymously request assistance, and offer tips for healthy eating on a budget.

Drone programmers are essential in the drone industry because they create the software that allows drones to fly, navigate, and perform specific tasks. They write code for flight control systems, autonomous navigation, and data processing. Without programmers, drones would be unable to execute complex missions or operate safely. According to ZipRecruiter, the average salary for a drone programmer in Texas is around $92,000 per year. The required education typically includes a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field, as well as experience with programming languages like C++ or Python and knowledge of drone technology and regulations.

Self-driving cars might fail to recognize a stopped school bus due to blockage, where other vehicles or objects obstruct the view. Poor lighting or weather conditions can also impair the cameras and sensors. The AI might struggle if its training data lacks sufficient examples of school buses with extended stop signs in various environments. As a Waymo programmer, I would implement a sensor fusion system that combines data from cameras, lidar, and radar to create a more robust understanding of the environment. I would also add a software rule that triggers an emergency stop if a large, yellow vehicle with specific dimensions and flashing lights is detected, regardless of stop sign recognition. This redundancy would ensure greater safety around school buses.

When doing anything on the internet it is important to stay safe and protected when doing so. A lot of times when people are on the internet they are unaware of the countless bullies that are waiting, many times being people that they know. An example of this is the gaming community. Kids around the world love playing video games, with some even building a carrer out of playing them and building good skills and freindships off of them. But studies show that most people in the gaming community experience bullying, with surveys showing numbers as high as 75-80% of people experiencing bullying online. This is a major problem in america with many kids suffering from
