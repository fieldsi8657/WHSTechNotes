So far learning how to code using phyton so far has been very interesting and has introduced to a very complex and hard way of coding. 
Wile learning phyton iv'e seen a lot of things from math such as variales which allow you to save or assign data to a placeholder  that you can reference, manipulate, and move around later in the code. And integers, integers can be saved to variables much like strings can.

When creating my journal i didn't have a lot of problems following the instructions for creating it. The only challeges i faced when creating and doing my journal was finding the journal prompts, other than that it wasn't difficult creating it.

Doing Phyton and doing Sphero, i can say that doing phyton is a harder and more complex coding style. While Sphero coding is you putting a bunch of commands toghether to make the thing your controll move and do something. While phyton takes much more thinking and requires focus to code becasue putting the wrong thing can mess up what your trying to do.
