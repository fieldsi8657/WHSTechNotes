So far learning how to code using phyton so far has been very interesting and has introduced to a very complex and hard way of coding. 
Wile learning phyton iv'e seen a lot of things from math such as variales which allow you to save or assign data to a placeholder  that you can reference, manipulate, and move around later in the code. And integers, integers can be saved to variables much like strings can.

When creating my journal i didn't have a lot of problems following the instructions for creating it. The only challeges i faced when creating and doing my journal was finding the journal prompts, other than that it wasn't difficult creating it.

Doing Phyton and doing Sphero, i can say that doing phyton is a harder and more complex coding style. While Sphero coding is you putting a bunch of commands toghether to make the thing your controll move and do something. While phyton takes much more thinking and requires focus to code becasue putting the wrong thing can mess up what your trying to do.

Computer Science is used everyday in my life i use it when i need to look up something on google or when i'm using my phone. Without these things in my life it would be very diffrent especially witout my phone i woudn't be able to text the people i know or call them either i also wouldn't be able to take pictures to save good memories i have.

Software Development
Looking at all the options in computer science i feel like becoming a softeare developer, intrest me the most. Software Developers job is to desgin, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many diffrent skills and tools. To become a software developer you need to have certain skills such as Programming languages, Data structures and algorithms, Databases, and so on and so on. Aslo to become a developer you need at least a bachelor's degree in a related field, such as computer science, software engineering, computer and information technology, or engineering. This job algins with my interest because i like computers and learning about the coding and software development seems very interesting to me and challenging.

Coding is an skill that goes beyond just computer science, learning to code can sharpen your mind and help with your creativity. Coding can also help with solving problems because when you are programing you must break down complex issues into smaller managable parts and think logically while doing so. Coding can also help with other things outside of computer science; it can help with multiple things of you life such as critical thinking, quicker problem sovlving skills, and also helps with you confidence, which overall help in your day to day life where you can use in other jobs you are interested in. Programming languages can develop student creativity by encouraging problem-solving, supporting personal and collaborative projects, enabling experimentation, and providing practical applications. They empower students to think innovatively and express creativity through code.

Artificial Intelligence or AI, is an helpful computer programed assittant that mimics human intelligence and is used in your day to day life, like your phones,social media,digital assistiant, and homeelectronics. Using AI as a whole has benefited humans in many ways, some things as simple setting an alarm to wake up or coding a program for a website. As much as Ai helps everybody everyday it also comes with potential risk. One common brought up topic about AI being a risk is the is it too helpful, as thechnolgy advances everyday and how much people rely on it does it effect the way of human life. One example of this is with AI advancing people lose jobs which makes it hard for people to look for jobs and keep them. As AI advances everyday a lot of people are worried for the future, seeing if AI will be the downfall of the human race or help for the better.

One of the significant positive impacts of technology on the election process is the introduction of e-voting or electronic voting.This system leverages advanced encryptio mathods to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of votes. For instance, countries like the United States have adopted this method to replace the traditional paper ballot system. Despite the benifits, the use of thechnology in elections also presents potential challenges. One of the main concers is the susceptibility of these systems to hacking or cyber-attacks.

Artificial Intelligence continues to shape the way people live and work in their day to day lives. Whith such quick advancments in AI everday there is something new about AI, an example of these advances is Multimodal AI. Multimodal AI is a single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information. With this people are able to preform complex tasks by combining different data types like text, images, audio, and video, enabling actions such as analyzing a photo while understanding spoken instructions about it, generating descriptive text responses, and making informed decisions based on diverse information sources; making it useful in applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, customer service, and advanced security systems.
