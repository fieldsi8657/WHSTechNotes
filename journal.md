So far learning how to code using phyton so far has been very interesting and has introduced to a very complex and hard way of coding. 
Wile learning phyton iv'e seen a lot of things from math such as variales which allow you to save or assign data to a placeholder  that you can reference, manipulate, and move around later in the code. And integers, integers can be saved to variables much like strings can.
